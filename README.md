|Name|Version|Description|
|---|---|---|
|[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)|1.6.5|AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser.|
|[AngularJS-Animate]()|1.6.5|The ngAnimate module provides support for CSS-based animations (keyframes and transitions) as well as JavaScript-based animations via callback hooks.

|[AngularJS-Aria]()|1.6.5|The ngAria module provides support for common ARIA attributes that convey state or semantic information about the application for users of assistive technologies, such as screen readers.|
|[AngularJS-Messages]()|1.6.5|The ngMessages module provides enhanced support for displaying messages within templates (typically within forms or when rendering message objects that return key/value data). Instead of relying on JavaScript code and/or complex ng-if statements within your form template to show and hide error messages specific to the state of an input field, the ngMessages and ngMessage directives are designed to handle the complexity, inheritance and priority sequencing based on the order of how the messages are defined in the template.|
